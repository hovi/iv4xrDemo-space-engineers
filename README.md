<img src="./docs/iv4xr_logo_1200dpi.png" width="20%"> Space Engineers Demo

This is a demo for the [iv4XR testing framework](https://github.com/iv4xr-project/aplib), demonstrating that iv4XR test agents can control [_Space Engineers_](https://www.spaceengineersgame.com/) (a game by [Keen Software House](https://www.keenswh.com/)) to perform some testing tasks. This repository started as a fork of the [*Lab Recruits* demo](https://github.com/iv4xr-project/iv4xrDemo), but has been significantly modified since.

It is not intended for general uses, other than as a testing project for the development of the [Space Engineers iv4XR plugin](https://github.com/iv4xr-project/iv4xr-se-plugin). For more details, please refer to the plugin repository README.

Demo is written in Kotlin, which is JVM language by JetBrains and is fully interoperable with Java, i.e. can be used seamless from Java while allowing us to write less code with same functionality.


# Setup

## Requirements

Project requires [aplib](https://github.com/iv4xr-project/aplib) dependency. First build `aplib` and install it to Maven local.
Other possibility at the moment is to change dependency do JitPack:

```
implementation 'com.github.iv4xr-project:aplib:v1.2.0'
```

## Cloning repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:iv4xr-project/iv4xrDemo-space-engineers.git
```

## Building project

We are using Gradle as the build system. To build project, run gradle task `build`:

```
./gradlew build
```


## Running unit tests

To build and run unit tests, run:

```
./gradlew :cleanJvmTest :jvmTest --tests "spaceEngineers.mock.*"
```

## Running iv4xr tests

The tests require Space Engineers running with the iv4XR plugin enabled.


```
./gradlew :cleanJvmTest :jvmTest --tests "spaceEngineers.iv4xr.*"
```


## Running BDD feature tests

Tests scenarios also require Space Engineers running with the iv4XR plugin enabled.

For now, we run BDD tests from IDEA.

* Make sure you have installed [plugins](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/enabling-cucumber-support-in-project.html#cucumber-plugin) `Gherkin` and `Cucumber for Java`
* Right-click [.feature file](https://github.com/iv4xr-project/iv4xrDemo-space-engineers/tree/se-dev/src/jvmTest/resources/features) in IDEA and select "Run".
